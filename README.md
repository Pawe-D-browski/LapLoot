LapLoot is a free tool that allows you to automatically generate sale offers for your devices in seconds, using fastfetch and AI.

All you need to do is run LapLoot on your device, add information that can't be automatically retrieved (such as outward condition), and click generate. Don't forget to check your offer, since AI can make mistakes.

Note that you will need a Google Gemini API key to test LapLoot (you can get one for free from the Google AI developer portal).

Please report any problems that you may encounter.
